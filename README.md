# 👨‍💻 Anthony Gomez – Personal Projects Repository

Welcome to my personal development space! This repository is home to a collection of hands-on projects I've built to sharpen my skills, explore new technologies, and demonstrate my growth as an aspiring cloud engineer and developer.

Whether you're here to explore specific tools, evaluate my skills, or follow my journey, I'm glad you're here. Feel free to clone, fork, or contribute.

## 🧠 About Me

Hi, I'm **Anthony Gomez** — a driven and curious self-learner with a background in customer support and small business ownership. I’m currently working as a **Customer Support Specialist II** while actively transitioning into **cloud engineering**.

I'm focused on building strong foundations in:

- **AWS & cloud infrastructure**
- **Python & automation**
- **SQL & data handling**
- **Scripting for real-world efficiency**

My long-term goal is to become a highly skilled cloud engineer, capable of building scalable tools, automating manual processes, and helping others learn along the way.
