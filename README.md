##  About Me

Hi, I'm **Anthony Gomez** â€” a driven and curious self-learner with a background in customer support and small business ownership. Iâ€™m currently working as a **Customer Support Specialist II** while actively transitioning into **cloud engineering**.

I'm focused on building strong foundations in:

- **AWS & cloud infrastructure**
- **Python & automation**
- **SQL & data handling**
- **Scripting for real-world efficiency**

My long-term goal is to become a highly skilled cloud engineer, capable of building scalable tools, automating manual processes, and helping others learn along the way.
