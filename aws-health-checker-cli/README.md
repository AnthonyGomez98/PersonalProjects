# ü©∫ AWS Health Checker CLI

A lightweight Python tool that fetches AWS Health events using the AWS Health API, with optional filters by region, service, and time range.

##  Features

- Filter AWS Health events by:
  - Region (e.g., `us-east-1`)
  - Service (e.g., `EC2`)
  - Start/end time
- Optional summary mode for quick event count
- Uses `boto3` and standard Python libraries

##  Example Usage

```bash
# List all EC2 events in us-east-1
python aws_health_checker.py --region us-east-1 --service EC2 --start-time 2025-07-01 --end-time 2025-08-01

# Just show total number of events
python aws_health_checker.py --start-time 2025-07-01 --end-time 2025-08-01 --summary
